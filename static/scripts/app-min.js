 * ALL external libraries and should be imported here, using a buildout
 * application e.g. CodeKit. This vesion of the file should be pretty,
 * well formatted, and only contain code that is unique to your OWN app.
 * Your site should always use /app-min.js when loading, which contains
 * a minified version of this script prepended with all external scripts.
 *
 * STYLE:
 *
 * All code should be within 79 characters wide to meet standard Hatchd
 * protocol. Reformat code cleanly to fit within this tool.
